# SignLanguageDetectionUsingML
Built a Python-based sign language detection system using OpenCV and Mediapipe for real-time hand gesture recognition.

Trained a machine learning model to identify and convert hand gestures into text to assist communication for deaf and mute individuals.

Used image preprocessing and gesture tracking techniques to improve accuracy and real-time performance.

Designed a simple GUI to display translated text output from webcam-based gesture input.
